# Seismology2
Seismology 2 project - MATLAB scripts

# This repository contains 4 MATLAB scripts:
1. cmt_inversion.m

   
This script contains the code used to perform a CMT source inversion on three-component waveform data, plus some additional calculations.


2. cmt_inversion_v.m


This script contains the code used to perform a CMT source inversion on single-component (vertical) waveform data, plus some additional calculations.


3. cmt_inversion_zero_trace.m


This script contains the code used to perform a CMT source inversion on three-component waveform data with imposed trace=0, plus some additional calculations.


4. cmt_inversion_subset.m


This script contains the code used to perform a CMT source inversion on three-component waveform data on only 6 selected seismic stations closest to the epicenter(SJG, SACV, SFJD, ESK, BFO, PAB), plus some additional calculations.
